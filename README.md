# SpinTemperature

This project contains code used in "21 cm cosmology and spin temperature reduction via spin-dependent dark matter interactions"
(Widmark, JCAP 1906 (2019) 014, https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09552).

This code is written in Python and uses the following packages: numpy, scipy, matplotlib

The code consists of three scripts:

CrossSection.py -- This script contains the form factors and cross sections of dark matter-hydrogen interactions (see section 2.2 in the paper)

DiffEqs.py -- Contains functions that calculate how the spin temperature evolves with redshift

PlotsForPaper.py -- Code to produces the plots seen in the paper
